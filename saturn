Machine Learning Term Project
Topic: Pulsar Star Classification based on Radio Frequency Characteristics
Developed by: Akbota Kuresbay

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a classification system for cosmic objects (pulsars) using machine learning algorithms implemented "from scratch." 
This project demonstrates the fundamental mechanics of gradient descent and statistical modeling applied to real-world astronomical data.

Dataset Description
I use the Predicting a Pulsar Star dataset (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/colearninglounge/predicting-pulsar-starintermediate).
Dataset Size: 17,898 samples (meets the >2000 rows requirement).
Features: 8 numerical characteristics of the pulsar's integrated radio profile and DM-SNR curve.
Task: Binary Classification (Class 1: Pulsar / Class 0: RFI - Radio Frequency Interference/Noise).

Key Tasks & Implementation
Linear Regression: Manual implementation of Gradient Descent using NumPy to explore feature correlations.
Logistic Regression: Built from scratch, including the implementation of the Sigmoid function and the Log-Loss cost function.
Model Comparison: Performance analysis between our manual Logistic Regression and a library-based Decision Tree (Scikit-learn).
Interactive Visualization: Interactive dashboards in Google Colab using widgets to demonstrate the effect of hyperparameters like Learning Rate.
